        We were required to work in groups and focus especially on the styling operation. I decided to face this new experience not from a concept, but by doing a search for clothes who themselves told a story. By visiting different thrift shop, we found pieces
        that have given us a feeling that could be communicated in the way we were thinking.

      She wanders for this abandoned house. <br> Her face is never seen, as a specter without identity, a figure without memory <br> trying to find herself wearing the clothes she finds in that home, living in the environments and
      <br> trying to fit them but without succeeding.

        This feeling of non-belonging remains. We made the idea of a ghost through blurry photos, motionless and plastic poses.
