      I decided to face this theme reading the movement as a political and moral. So I start an historical research on the subject. I choose the one i felt closer to me: the suffragette. However, I realized during this study that I needed to strengthen this concept bringing back a series of physical elements that helps me to develop volumes.

        I opted for the idea of hybridization thanks to a parallel search on the world of boxing women of the â€˜30s. This allowed me to bring the idea of movement from the abstract to the concrete. I could then decide materials, shapes, volumes, and colors.

        I focused on finishes and details. During this phase I had the chance to experience weaves and finishes. I wanted to hybridize the brandy leather with more technical fabrics. I then created a new material, made by a layer of technical microbase, one of jute and one of synthetic fabric. In some seams I inserted a filetto worked with a waxed lacing piping. This has become the theme of design. For this reason also the puller was replaced with a handmade one.
